            I'm a beginner programmer currently on my tough journey to professionalism,
            but i refuse to give up! Playing piano and gaming are my favorite hobbies

            this and you happen to be a employer looking for a hard working guy with an
            aspiration to learn, then be sure to check out my contact section at the
